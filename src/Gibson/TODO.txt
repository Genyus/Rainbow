// TODO: moving items changes the parent ID in teh index but not the path
// TODO: moving stuff around seems to occasionally delete items
// TODO: need a way to ignore moving descendants of moves to ignored paths in the predicate
	e.g. you move /foo/bar to /foot/bar. but /foot/bar/baz is on ignore list. the moved baz item should be deleted instead of moved. see movedescendants in the old serialization provider.
